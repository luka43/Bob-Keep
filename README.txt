Started working on this project after years of no coding. Acctualy last time I coded I was at elementary school â‰ˆ 15 years ago.

The idea came from a friend who has a small bar in town and a lot of clients drink on a tab and pay on other day so he has to write down by hand alot of orders.

So I found an idea for my training app, BOB-Keep wich stands for Bar Owner Books Keeper.

Everything was coded in Python with Tkinter library. Never coded in python before this. Only Qbasic, Vbasic, html, css, php.

Stoped working on it as I'm learning C# now but might revisit the idea in the future.
